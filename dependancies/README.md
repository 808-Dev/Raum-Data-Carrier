Dependancies are modules for the carrier that are required to operate with safe guards to ensure that
users are able to safely and securely use the carriers services.
<br><br>
While modifications are allowed to be made, it is highly encouraged that you understand the purpose and
usage of these services. If a service breaks in this folder, the entire carrier instance will crash.
